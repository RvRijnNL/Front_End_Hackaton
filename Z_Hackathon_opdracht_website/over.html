        <h1>HOW WHISKEY IS MADE</h1>

        <p>The beginning of whiskey making:
        
            The first step of whiskey making is malting the barley (corn or rye). In this first step, two things happen:
        <ol>
            <li> If you use barley in the production process, it will germinate after it has soaked for 2 to 3 days. It is then dried on the germination floor, where the starch in the barley is then converted into sugar. These present sugars later become alcohol.</li>
        
            <li> The germination of the barley stops when the barley is placed in the drying oven (klin). This is where barley malt (germinated barley) is produced.</li>
            The fuel in the drying oven contributes to the final taste of the whisky. For example, in Scotland peat is often used, so that they get a characteristic aroma. This makes the whiskeys taste smoky.
        
            <li> MASHING OF WHISKY </li>
            The second step in whiskey making is grinding the malt until it becomes flour. This is done in the mash tun. Warm water is added to this tub. The reaction of the grist and warm water removes the sugars from the grist. A mash is now formed which is called 'the wort'. From this batter comes a liquid that seeps through small holes from the bottom of the tank into the so-called wash basin. This process is called mashing.
        
            <li> FERMENTING THE WHISKEY</li>
            The third step of whiskey making is fermentation. Two things happen to the liquid that is now in the washback.
        
            <li>Yeast is added to the wort. This causes a fermentation process to take place. The yeast ensures that the sugars present in the wort change into alcohol and carbon dioxide.</li>
        
            <li>The fermentation of the wort causes it to foam. When the foam has disappeared after a while, the distillation starts.</li>
            After about 3 days, a drink called a wash remains. This drink contains about 5% alcohol. If you were going to brew this wash you would get beer. But of course we want whiskey, so that's why we continue!
        
            <li>THE WHISKEY DISTILLATION</li>
            Distillation means that water and alcohol are separated. For example, vodka is often distilled and whiskey is sometimes distilled 3 times. This distillation takes place in a copper still where they heat the wash above the boiling point. Two things happen in these boilers.
        
            <li> The wash in the boiler is first heated so-called pot still. This means that the liquid evaporates and the liquid vapor rises to the neck of the pot still, where it condenses. This first distillate is also called low wine and the whiskey now contains about 20% alcohol.</li>
        
            <li> The low wine is now pushed to the second still. This is called the spirit still. In the spirit still, the remaining alcohol is divided into 3 parts. Only the alcohol in the middle component is used to make whiskey. This alcohol has a percentage of about 67%.</li>
            This step also ensures that the whiskey gets its unique taste. For example, stills with long "necks" often have a softer and finer taste. Stills with short and wide necks have a richer and fuller taste.
        
            <li>MATURE OF THE WHISKEY</li>
            After the whiskey has been distilled, the whiskey is stored in wooden barrels. The longer the whiskey matures, the more the aroma, color and aromas develop. The taste and smell of the whiskey depend very much on the duration and the barrels used in the maturation.
            Although the barrels are properly sealed, an average of 2% alcohol evaporates annually, because the barrels are porous. Real whiskey connoisseurs call this the angel's share. And this makes older whiskeys more expensive and rare: there is less whiskey left over the longer the maturation process.

            <li>BOTTLING OF WHISKEY</li>
            Now we are finally at the final step of how wshiky is made. The bottling of the whiskey does not actually affect the final taste of the whiskey, but is intended for the marketing of the brand. For example, Jack Daniels has his typical square bottle of whiskey.
            Unlike wine, whiskey does not mature further in the bottle. A 12-year-old whiskey in wood, therefore, also remains a 12-year-old whisky. A whiskey that has matured for three years is a 3 year old whisky.
            The road from three ingredients (grain, water and yeast) to your glass of whiskey is a long one. Ripening in particular can take a lot of time. But after a long ripening you often get a phenomenal whisky!

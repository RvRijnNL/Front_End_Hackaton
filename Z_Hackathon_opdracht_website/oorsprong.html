    <h1>HISTORY</h1>

    <p></p>
    The art of distillation was discovered by the Arabs. Medieval itinerant monks introduced the distillation technique to Ireland and Scotland. The Irish and Scots soon distilled a powerful and tasty drink from barley: whiskey.

    The history of whiskey actually starts long before the beginning of our era. The art of distillation probably ended up in Europe via the Arabs. The Arabs distilled perfumed water from flowers and called this distillate al-koh'l, the refined. At the beginning of the Middle Ages, itinerant monks brought the knowledge of distillation to Ireland. There they made a drink from barley to which they attributed medicinal powers, aqua vitae. In Celtic this "water of life" was called uisge beatha. When the British conquered Ireland, this name was corrupted from fuisce to whiskey.

    It was probably Irish missionaries who in turn introduced the distillation technique to Scotland. In any case, it can be said with certainty that whiskey has been produced in Scotland since 1494. Distilling whiskey became very popular in that country, even in the most inhospitable areas. Whiskey was mainly produced for the market in Scotland, Ireland, England and other parts of the British Empire. In the 19th century, Irish settlers took their whiskey making knowledge with them to the United States. Whiskey is still spelled Irish there, so as whiskey instead of whiskey. Nowadays, good whiskeys also come from countries such as New Zealand and Japan.

            <h1>TYPES OF WHISKY</h1>
            <p>There are three different types of Scotch whiskey: malt whiskey (also known as single malt), grain whiskey and blended whiskey. But how do they differ?
            </p>
            <h3>MALT WHISKY</h3>
            <p>Malt whiskey is made with malted barley, water and yeast. The liquid is distilled in large copper stills (you'll see them on most distillery tours) and aged in whiskey barrels for at least three years (although most whiskey is aged for much longer). Single malt whiskey is produced at one distillery while blended malt whiskey is the product of two or more distilleries.
            </p>
            <h3>GRAIN WHISKY</h3>
            <p>Grain whiskey is made completely differently. The barley malt is mixed with unmalted barley and other grains (such as corn and wheat) before the whole mixture is combined with water and then yeast. The resulting liquid is distilled in a high patent still (or Coffey still), which looks very different from the traditional still and produces more drink at a much higher strength.
            </p>
            <h3>BLENDED WHISKY</h3>
            <p>Blended whiskey requires an intricate process of blending several single malts (from 15 to 50) with grain whiskey. It's a complex process. Whiskeys from different distilleries have their own character and don't always mix well with certain other varieties. That's why the art of blending is a special skill and recipes are a closely guarded secret. Many blended whiskeys are now household names, including Bells, Dewars, Whyte & Mackay, Johnnie Walker and The Famous Grouse.
